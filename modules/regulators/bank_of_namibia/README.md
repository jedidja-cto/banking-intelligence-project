======================

What this institution is
------------------------

The Bank of Namibia is the central bank of Namibia. It is responsible for
monetary policy, issuing currency, managing foreign reserves, and overseeing
key parts of the financial system, including payment systems and certain
classes of financial institutions.

Why it matters in the financial system

The Bank of Namibia shapes the structure and resilience of the financial
system through:

- Monetary policy and liquidity management
- Regulation and supervision of banks and other institutions
- Oversight of payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructure
- Support for financial stability and inclusion objectives

Its mandates and tools define much of the operating environment for the other
modules in this lab.
