Current bank flow for Silver PAYU
=================================

Purpose
-------

Outline, at a high level, how a personal customer currently discovers and applies for the Silver Pay-as-you-use account using public digital journeys.

Scope
-----

- Entry via Nedbank Namibia personal banking navigation.
- Focus on the Silver Pay-as-you-use everyday account.
- Digital paths only; in-branch processes are out of scope for v0.1.

Observed
--------

- Navigation uses Personal > Bank > Explore Bank > Accounts > Everyday banking.
- The Silver Pay-as-you-use product page exposes:
  - Positioning as a low monthly fee, pay-as-you-use account.
  - A stated monthly fee.
  - Eligibility and required documentation.
  - Multiple onboarding channels (web callback, Facebook IdentityToday selfie, branch, call centre).

Inferred
--------

- The same account may be opened across different channels with broadly similar eligibility requirements, even if user experience differs.

Assumed
-------

- Channel-specific internal processing steps are not yet modelled.
- Detailed back-office workflows and exception handling are not captured for v0.1.

Proposed
--------

- Use this flow description as the reference context for synthetic data generation and future API or UI design.
