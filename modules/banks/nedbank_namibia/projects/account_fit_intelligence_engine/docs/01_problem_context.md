Account Fit Intelligence Engine problem context
===============================================

Purpose
-------

Describe the real-world problem this project addresses for personal customers using the Silver Pay-as-you-use account.

Scope
-----

- Focus on transaction behaviour and fee impact for the Silver Pay-as-you-use account.
- Customer segment: personal.
- Geography: Namibia.

Observed
--------

- Silver Pay-as-you-use is positioned as a low monthly fee, pay-as-you-use account.
- Public documentation highlights everyday usage patterns such as card payments, transfers, and utility purchases.

Inferred
--------

- Customers with different transaction patterns may experience materially different effective fees on the same account type.

Assumed
-------

- Detailed transaction-level fee tables are not yet captured; fee modelling is limited to known fixed monthly fees until the fee schedule is documented.

Proposed
--------

- Use synthetic transaction data to explore how different behaviour profiles might interact with the PAYU fee model, without using any real customer data.
